## CONNECT – Prototype for Women’s Empowerment  

👉 **Project Link**: https://lovable.dev/projects/30f6c034-3261-4a2c-9d00-1e6dc08c5640

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Under **SDG 5 (Gender Equality)** many rural and underrepresented women still face barriers to **education, digital literacy, and awareness of their rights and opportunities**. With **1 in 5 people excluded under international human rights law**, the core issue lies in the lack of **inclusive knowledge access and empowerment platforms** tailored for these communities.  

## 🎯 Solution  
For the hackathon, I built a prototype app called **CONNECT** using **[Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)**. The goal was to empower rural women (ages 15–30) and marginalized communities by creating an **inclusive, accessible digital platform**.  

The app provides three key features:  

### 📚 Educate  
- 30+ curated categories of **free learning resources**  
- Designed for **digital beginners**, localized for accessibility  
- Similar to platforms like Udemy, but open-access and community-friendly  

### 🔨 Build  
- A **guided space** to brainstorm business ideas or explore job pathways  
- Includes **step-by-step roadmaps** and actionable learning journeys  
- Encourages entrepreneurship and career readiness  

### 🏛 Government Support  
- A **simple, filterable guide** to existing government schemes and financial aid  
- Brings awareness to programs often unknown to rural or marginalized audiences  
- Helps bridge the gap between policy and actual access
